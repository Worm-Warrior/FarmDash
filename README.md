# FarmDash

This is my first project using C#.

I wanted to build a mock site where you can enter data into the site and it will interact with a database, with some basic sorting and searching.

You can click on the heading of each column in the data view page and sort by ascending or descending order.

You can text search for anything that contains the search string, or an exact match called "General Search" and "Exact Search" respectively.

That feature can also be combined with a field-specific searchâ€”such as FarmID:1, which would return any farm that has a 1 anywhere in the FarmID, but exact search would return the farm with FarmID=1.

It has a very basic login and logout feature as well.
